                <h2>About Kristen</h2>
                <h6>A holistic approach for a new age of hairdressing</h6>
                <p>KP has been working behind the chair for a decade helping women achieve an enhanced natural look. She was raised in small town midwest and followed her dreams all the way to New York City to become who she is today. After 4 years of experiencing various types of salons and apprenticeship programs she found her niche market and her love for free lance hair dressing. She has built her entire clientele on word of mouth and retained her clients by building strong relationships and maintaining them.
                <br/><br/>KP's objective is to encourage women to fall in love with being more themselves. Her technique incorporates the clients natural hair color and allows them to wear it 4, 6, 8, months or longer with a seamless grow out. Her specific technique allows her to do transformations in a matter of hours without frequent salon visits for upkeep. She is passionate about the health of the clients hair and prides herself on educating clients how to take care of their delicate locks outside of the salon.
                <br/><br/>KP's entrepreneurial nature and ambitious work ethic keeps her open to new opportunities. She loves collaborating with other stylists, adding new cities to her rotation, and sharing her knowledge with other hairdressers who want a hands on experience.
                <br/><br/>KP's passion for health, beauty, and women empowerment sets her apart from the rest. She divides her time between several cities working behind the chair, is an NPC bikini athlete, and is a virtual holistic health coach.</p>
