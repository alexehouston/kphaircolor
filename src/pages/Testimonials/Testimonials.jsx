                    <p>
                        Kristen is one of the best colourists I have ever seen. I’ve had issues with bad color before, and came to her ver weary. She put my mind at ease and I feel in such good hands. I brought to her an inspiration picture, and she is the first stylist to get it spot on. The blonde color she does, makes it look so natural. The technique she uses allows for the color to last much longer than most, and it will look like you are a natural blonde. I traveled from Canada to get my hair done, and next time Im in Chicago I will go to her again.

                    <h3>"The Best"</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kristen is the absolute best. I have been getting blonde highlights all my life. I was never super happy with them but I didn't know why. After I had my first experience with Kristen I realized most hairdressers have no clue how to do blonde. Kristen is an expert. I've had her do a few different shades for me… all perfection. Also, the technique she uses allows you to go 6 months plus without having to get your hair done! It's a money saver. I can't tell you how happy I am. I would recommend her to EVERYONE looking for great hair.
